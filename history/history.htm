                  of Carleton Shores </span><br>
                  by Jill Jillson
                  <p>Carleton Shores is located in the section of Sandwich formerly
                    called Scorton Neck. Old deeds refer to it as an area in
                    the northeast corner
       of Sandwich bordered south and west by Scorton Creek, north by the Bay,
      east by Sandy Neck and Great Marsh in Barnstable.      </p>
                  <p>Indians had inhabited this area. The last encampment of
                    the Scorton Indians (part of the Wampanoag tribe) was on
                    the dunes at Carleton
        shores. Arrowheads have been found from time to time in  
        the area. A Spanish doubloon was also found. There were some who  
        believed the coin to be part of a pirate treasusre trove. However, no
                    other evidence of this stash was ever found.</p>
                  <p> Three large farms took up this area. The Nye farm encompassed
                    the current Wingscorton Farm and Sandwich Downs. The Armstrong
                    farm was the
                      present Meadow Springs Farm and the development to the
                    beach. The H. T.
          Wing farm, which had belonged to the Wing family since the 1670's,
                    was about 200 acres and is now Carleton Shores. It included
                    the
                      area now
          known as Long Hill and Beachplum Circle. This farm was bought by Hiram
                      Carleton in 1881 for his son John Fisher Carleton. John
                    Carleton had
          wanted to be a farmer. His father Hiram Carleton, a minister, promised
                      him that if he went to Harvard, he would buy him a farm
                    when he
          graduated from college.      </p>
                  <p>The farm was crisscrossed by stonewalls. An early picture
                    shows these walls and a much more open landscape than is
                    now seen.
                    (Of course, this
          is true of most of the Cape. In 1900, the land had far fewer trees
                    as fields had been cleared and wood cut for heating. With
                    the
                      advent of
          central heating and the passing of small farming, much of the land
                    has gone back to trees. In spite of development, the Cape
                    has
                      more
          woodlands now than 100 years ago.) The road (the current Route 6A)
                    was unpaved and ran only as far as the marsh at the edge of Scorton Creek.  
          At that time, one had to go over the bridge on Jones Lane to County Road  
          in order to ride to Sandwich or Barnstable.</p>
                  <p> In the early 1900's the road was paved. The state bought
                    up the stonewalls on the nearby farms for $1,000 and crushed
                    the stones with a
            steam crusher. The state workers also opened the sandpit on the west
                    side of the hill which slopes toward Jillson Way. They took
                    gravel and
            sand for a road foundation. At that time the bridge over Scorton
                    Creek was built. It was rebuilt in the 1930's. There are
                    still a few wood
            pilings left from the temporary bridge which was put up at that time.
                    These can be seen to the left of 6A as one drives toward
                    Sandwich.      </p>
                  <p>There was a large old house on the H. T. Wing farm when
                    it was purchased by Hiram Carleton. It was very close to
                    the present road.
                      There were also several barns on the property. The oldest
                      was built in
              the early 1700's. It is now incorporated as a garage into the house
                      at 613 Rte 6A. The house dated from the 1670's. It burned
                      on February 2,
              1900. The fire began in the chimney and burned downwards. Had help
                      been near at hand, the house might have been saved. But
                    the men pulled
              out as much as the could from the lower floors and had to watch
                    helplessly as the fire burned the house down. The Carleton
                      family,
              which then consisted of four girls, a boy, and a baby on the way,
                      went to stay with the Armstong family at Meadow Springs.
                      A new house in the
              foursquare style was built and ready for the family to mave back
                      to the farm in June, just before the last baby of the family
                      was born. This
              house, with additions in 2000, still stands on the rise above Rte
                      6A. John's greatgranddaughter Cynthia Jillson Myers and
                    her
                      husband Mike
              live there now. There was no electricity in the original house,
                    but there was a pump in the kitchen so there was &quot;indoor plumbing&quot;.</p>
                  <p> John Carleton raised chickens and cows, had a vegetable
                    garden, and tended the fruit trees (apple pear, and cherry)
                    on the property.
                Several of the pear trees still blossom every spring and produce
                    a few pears. John began to develop cranberry bogs to raise
                    the fruit
                commercially. Several of his bogs were put in along what is now
                    Caarleton Drie East, just beyond the Bruce and Helen Jillson
                    house. He
                also began to raise blueberries in the 1920's. The first fields
                    were developed along Rte 6A and much of the acreage now belongs
                    to the
                Sandwich Conservation Commission. In 1946, his son John Foxcroft
                    Carleton, know as Jack, put in blueberries in what was known
                    as the &quot;nursery&quot;. This field is now tended by John Carleton's great-grandson  
                Bruce Jillson. Bruce does the work here and gererously shares his crop  
                with neighbors and friends, who eagerly await the ripening of the  
    &quot;blues&quot; and Bruce's invitation to pick their own.</p>
                  <p> Parts of the farm were divided off for family members along
                    the way. In the 20's Sam Foxcroft, John Carleton's brother-in-law,
                    bought a corner
                  of the farm which was later developed as Beach Plum Circle.
                    Sam and his sister Annie Foxcroft lived there. He worked
                    in his orchard and for his
                  brother-in-law. Sam died in 1962 and the house and land were
                    sold to Joe Birchall, whose heirs sold it to the developers
                    of Beach Plum
                  Circle.      </p>
                  <p>Also in the 20's a strip on the west side of the property
                    from the highway to the beach was sold to a group of hunters
                    from the
                      city. They built a cabin at the foot of the hill and raised
                      pheasnt and quail.
                    They then sold to John Shaw in the early 30's. The original
                      cabin burned, and the Shaws rebuilt at the top of the hill.
                      The Shaws then
                    sold this property to John Long who sold it to developers
                    who took down the old house and developed the property now
                    known
                    as Long Hill.</p>
                  <p> In 1932 the lot where Annie Lloyd's house now stands was
                    sold to her and her husband Louis. Annie was the daughter
                    of John Carleton.
                      Annie had
                    been a teacher until her marriage and then worked on the
                    family farm. Her husband Louis worked at the Keith Car Works
                    in
                      Sagamore and then for
                    the Cape Cod Mosquito Control. In later years, Annie raised
                      boxwood and holly tree which she sold to local landscaper,
                      shared with friends and
                    family, and gave to her church for Christmas Fairs. Her yard
                    was always full of flowers which delighted many.</p>
                  <p> In the late 30's, John sold a piece of land at the west
                    end of the blueberry fields to Marise Faucett and Yvonne
                    Rousseau who
                        built their Christmas shop there. They designed and printed
                        their own cards and
                      bought unique Christmas ornaments from various sources.
                    The Christmas shop, now enlarged, still stands in front of the blueberry fields.</p>
                  <p> In the early 30's the sandpit where the tennis courts are
                    now located was scraped out of the hill. At first the sand
                    was dug by hand. Jack
                      Jillson remembers that as teenagers, he and his friend
                    could load a flatbed
                      truck with 200 shovelsful apiece. They would then drive
                    the truck down to one of the bogs. As the truck was not a
                    dump truck, they then had to
                      unload the same 200 shovelsful by hand. They did 9 or 10
                    loads a day. The thrill was getting to drive the truck before
                    they were old enough
                    for licenses.</p>
                  <p> John Fisher Carleton died in 1940 at the age of 83. Hiis
                    son, John Foxcroft Carleton, known as Jack, then took over
                    the farm
                    operations. Jack was a graduate of U. Mass, then know as
                    Mass Aggie (Agricultural
                      College), and had worked with his father since graduation
                    from college. (He had taken time out to serve in World War
                    I and also had a brief
                      interlude in Florida where he ran a grapefruit farm.)      </p>
                  <p>During that time part of the farm was leased to the government
                    as an adjunt to Camp Edwards Army base (now Otis ANG). The
                    area
                    along the
                    beach was a practice range of the 68th Coast Artillery. The
                    original lease was
                      signed with Isabel Carleton, widow of the late John Fisher
                    Carleton, in June, 1941. In late 1941 the governement began
                    work on the property.
                      Following old cart trails, they built a road to the beach.
                    They developed a sandpit at the corners of Carlteon Drive
                    and Oak Ridge
                      Road. At the beach they had a firing range where the beach
                    parking lot now is. They put in a grid of roads to the barracks,
                    mess halls,
                      dispensaries, and latrines as well as a septic system,
                    storm drains, and water pipes from the water tower at the
                    top of the hill.      </p>
                  <p>Parts of those roads can be found under Carleton Drive East
                    and West and on the Gorton property. John and Blanche Gorton's garage
                      is part of the  old mess hall. It had been used as a garage
                      for some farm equipment and 
                        family autos after the war until the late 50's. There was
                      a water tower  at one of the high points of the property
                      in the area of Weathervane 
                        Lane. It was dismantled in the early 50's amd sold to a
                      company in  Mississippi.      </p>
                  <p>The army left in late 1944 as the war began to wind down.
                    In August, 1946, Isabel Foxcroft Carleton made an agreement
                    with Pride
                      Salvage of  Medford to dismantle and take away the buildings
                      which the government 
                        had left behind. This job was to be completed by January,
                      1947.        </p>
                  <p>The wooden gates at the foot of Carleton Drive were left
                    behind as were a few other buildings which the family kept
                    for their
                    use. Jack
                        Carleton converted one of the barracks into his family
                      home and another  was the home of Jack and Carol Jillson
                      until they built their home at in 1949. Their cottage
                    was then rented out by Jack Carleton in summers.      </p>
                  <p>In 1958 another Rte 6A lot was sold. AnnMarie Healy and
                    Babs Cannon bought the lot on the east side of Carleton Drive
                    on
                    the 6A side of the gateposts. They built a home and attached
                      a gift shop called the Cat 
                        and the Fiddle. In the ealy 60's the shop and home were
                      sold and became  a private home. It is now #2 Carleton
                    Drive.</p>
                  <p> In 1963, Jack Carleton died and his daughter Joy inherited
                    the farm. With the help of her cousin Jack Jillson (grandson
                    of
                        John Carleton by  way of his daughter Augusta), the farm
                        began to be developed. The Jack 
                          Carleton home and the cottage were removed from the
                    property. One is now a house on Old County Road, and the
                    other is
                        attached as an addition 
                    to a home on Rte 6A.</p>
                  <p> In 1964 the first beach lots were sold. Carleton Drive
                    was repaved, and Cranberry Circle, Blueberry Circle, Foxcroft Circle, and
                         Lloyd Lane were  carved out and paved. Foxcroft Lane is
                         named for John Fisher Carleton's 
                          wife's family as her maiden name had been Foxcroft. As
                         mentioned  earlier, her bachelor brother Sam and unmarried
                         sister Annie Foxcroft, 
                          had a home on part of the original farm. Lloyd Lane was
                         named for Annie  Carleton Lloyd, a daughter of John Fisher
                         and Isabel Foxcroft Carleton, 
                          who had married Louis Lloyd. They had also lived on part
                         of the farm.          </p>
                  <p>In 1963, Peter and Julie Meinl bought another piece of the
                    property on Rte 6A, now the David  Leary home. In
                    1965 the
                           barn built in 
                            the early 1700's was sold to Bill Thompson who built
                    his house there and attached to to the barn which was used
                           as a garage. 
                              
      Roads were laid out. Weathervane Lane was built in 1967, and Oak Ridge
                             was finished in l971. Joy Circle was also laid out
                    in
                           1971. Joy 
                            Carleton, daughter of John Foxcroft Carleton and
                    granddaughter of John Fisher Carleton, lives on this circle.
                    Lost Meadow
                           and the roads to the 
                            east of Carleton Drive were laid out in 1985. Jillson
                    Way was paved in 1995. (Jillson Way was named for Augusta
                    Carleton
                           Jillson, another of 
                            the daughters of John Fisher Carleton. Her son Jack
                    and some of his children still live at Carleton Shores, as
                           mentioned earlier.) The old 
                            barn on Jillson Way was moved to the Bruce Jillson
                    property
                            that same year.<br>
